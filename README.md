# FaceRecoginition
Face Recognition in Python.

It is build in Python based on KNN machine Learing Algorithm. It works on single face at a time. It first collect data and stored in numpy array and then recognize on sample data on live webcam. I uses haarcascade classifier for face classification.

### Run
 - First run face_data_collect.py
 - then run face_recognition.py
